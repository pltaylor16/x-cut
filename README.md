# x-cut

A module to compute the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya transformation including an interface to cosmosis.
  
You will need to add this directory to your PYTHONPATH to use the module!

The cosmosis module can be use to compute k-cut Cls or the x-cut statistic and it will overwrite the existing lensing correlation functions or Cls.
